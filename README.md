# Bayesian-AB-Test-Simulation
Estimating time to significance using Bayesian sampling

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
One of the primary roles that I filled while working at Bestow is the design and analysis of A/B tests of new products and user experience in conjunction with our product team.  However, a challenge that we faced at Bestow is that the volume of traffic we had moving through our funnel was too low to make traditional A/B testing practical.  I completed a Udemy course on Bayesian A/B testing using python, and conducted additional research to prepare a presentation on the advantages of the Bayesian approach.  The tl;dr version of the presentation is as follows:
  </p>

<b>Traditional A/B Testing</b>:
- Does not answers the question, “what is the probability that A  > B?”
- Requires larger samples
- Unlikely to detect incremental lifts
- Wastes money 
- Often inconclusive

<b>Bayesian A/B Testing</b>:
- Answers the question, “what is the probability that A > B?”
- Can quantify risk with smaller lifts and smaller sample
- Minimizes wasted spend 
- Flexible when deciding when to end an experiment and declaring a winner
